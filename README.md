# Fract_ol
Discover how to program in 2D and explore the mesmerizing world of fractals through this project utilizing the 42 MinilibX library. This project consists of creating a small fractal exploration program, through the Julia set and the Mandelbrot set.  
## Fractals

A fractal is a never-ending pattern. Fractals are infinitely complex patterns that are self-similar across different scales. They are created by repeating a simple process over and over in an ongoing feedback loop. Driven by recursion, fractals are images of dynamic systems – the pictures of Chaos. Mathematical fractals, like the Mandelbrot Set, are formed by calculating a simple equation thousands of times. These fractals are infinitely complex,  meaning we can zoom in forever. A fractal is made by repeating a simple process again and again.

## ALGEBRAIC FRACTALS : THE MANDELBROT SET

We can create fractals by repeatedly calculating a simple equation over and over. Because the equations must be calculated thousands or millions of times, we need computers to explore them. Not coincidentally, the Mandelbrot Set was discovered in 1980, shortly after the invention of the personal computer.

Anytime the value of the orbit goes beyond an absolute value of two, it is guaranteed to hit towards infinity. The orbits are contained within the area -2 to 2. Any point that has an orbit that escapes the radius 2 boundary is known to be outside the Mandelbrot set. So which points escape and which stay bounded. The values above 0.25 quickly escape and those below do not. 

## MiniLibX

It’s a tiny graphics school library which allows you to do the most basic things for rendering something in screens. It provides simple window creation, a questionable drawing tool, half-ass image functions and a weird event management system.
